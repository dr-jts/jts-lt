/**
 * Examples of constructing Geometries programmatically.

 * The Best Practice moral here is:
 * <quote>
 * Use the GeometryFactory to construct Geometries whenever possible.
 * </quote>
 * This has several advantages:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Simplifies your code
 * <li>allows you to take advantage of convenience methods provided by GeometryFactory
 * <li>Insulates your code from changes in the signature of JTS constructors
 * </ol>
