/**
 * Computes a triangulation of each polygon in a {@link Geometry}.
 * A polygon triangulation is a non-overlapping set of triangles which
 * cover the polygon and have the same vertices as the polygon.
 * The priority is on performance rather than triangulation quality,
 * so that the output may contain many narrow triangles.
 * <p>
 * Holes are handled by joining them to the shell to form a 
 * (self-touching) polygon shell with no holes.
 * Although invalid, this can be triangulated effectively.
 * <P>
 * For better-quality triangulation use {@link ConstrainedDelaunayTriangulator}.
