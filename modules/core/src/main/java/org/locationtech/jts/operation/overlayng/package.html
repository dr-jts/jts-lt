Contains classes that perform topological overlay to compute boolean spatial functions.
Overlay operations are used in spatial analysis for computing set-theoretic 
operations (boolean combinations) of input {@link Geometry}s.
</p>
<p>
Overlay operations include:
<ul>
<li>Intersection</li>
<li>Union</li>
<li>Difference</li>
<li>Symmetric Difference</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
 
</p>

An overview of the overlay algorithm is:

<ol>
<li>Extract linework and points from input geometries, with topology location information
<li>Check for empty input geometries, and return an empty result if appropriate for the specified operation
<li>(If optimization enabled) Apply overlap envelope optimizations:
  <ol>
  <li>For Intersection, check if the input envelopes are disjoint (using an envelope expansion adjustment to account for the precision grid).  
  <li>For Intersection and Difference, clip the linework of the input geometries to the overlap envelope.  
  <li>If the optimized linework is empty, return an empty result of appropriate type. 
  </ol>
<li>Node the linework and points.  For full robustness snap-rounding noding should be used. Other kinds of noder can be used as well (for instance, the same noding as the original overlay algorithm can be used).
<li>Merge noded edges.  Coincident edges from the two input geometries are merged, along with their topological labelling. Topology collapses are detected in this step, and are flagged in the labelling so they can be handled appropriately duing result polygon extraction
<li>Build a fully-labelled topology graph.  This process includes:
  <ol>
  <li>Create a graph structure on the noded, merged edges
  <li>Propagate topology locations around nodes in the graph
  <li>Label edges that have incomplete topology locations.  These occur when edges from an input geometry are isolated (disjoint from the edges of the other geometry in the graph)
  </ol>
<li>Generate the result geometry from the labelled graph:
  <ol>
  <li>Build result polygons - MORE DETAIL NEEDED
  <li>Build result linework - MORE DETAIL NEEDED
  <li>Build result points - MORE DETAIL NEEDED
  <li>Collect result geometries into the final result geometry
  </ol>
<li>If result is empty return an empty geometry of appropriate type
</ol>
