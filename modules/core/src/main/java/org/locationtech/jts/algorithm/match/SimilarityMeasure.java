 * An interface for classes which measures the degree of similarity between two {@link Geometry}s.

 * Higher measures indicate a great degree of similarity.
 * A measure of 1.0 indicates that the input geometries are identical
 * A measure of 0.0 indicates that the geometries
 * have essentially no similarity.
 * The precise definition of "identical" and "no similarity" may depend on the 
 * exact algorithm being used.
