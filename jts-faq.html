      <h2>A. General<a name="general"></a></h2>
      <h3> 1. What Java versions does JTS work with?<a name="A1"></a></h3>
      JTS is developed using Java 8. It should work with all newer versions.
      With a small amount of work the library can be made to work with almost
      all previous Java versions as well. <br>
      <h2>B. Design and Structure<a name="design"></a></h2>
      <h3>1. How can I use JTS algorithms with a different geometry model?<a name="B1"></a></h3>
      The solution to this is to use Facade objects which wrap the non-JTS
      geometry model classes. In order to avoid having to create and copy large
      numbers of <a class="javadoc" href="./javadoc/org/locationtech/jts/geom/Coordinate.html">Coordinate</a>
      objects, JTS provides the <a class="javadoc" href="./javadoc/index.html?org/locationtech/jts/geom/CoordinateSequence.html">CoordinateSequence</a>
      interface. A CoordinateSequence-based adapter can be written for whatever
      structure the foreign model uses to represent sequences of points. JTS
      <a class="javadoc" href="./javadoc/org/locationtech/jts/geom/Geometry.html">
        Geometry</a> objects will still need to be created to represent the
      structure of the geometries containing the points, but these are
      relatively lightweight in comparison. <br>
      <h3> 2. Why does JTS allow geometries to be constructed with invalid
        topology?<a name="B2"></a></h3>
      JTS intentionally allows topologically invalid geometries to be
      constructed for the following reasons:
      <br>
      <ol>
        <li> It allows a wider set of geometry to be read, stored and written
          from external data sources
        </li>
        <li> It allows geometries to be constructed and then validated </li>
        <li>It avoids the costly overhead of validating topology every time a
          geometry is constructed </li>
      </ol>
      <h3> 3. What is the difference between a Point and a Coordinate?<a name="B3"></a></h3>
      A <a class="javadoc" href="./javadoc/org/locationtech/jts/geom/Coordinate.html">Coordinate</a>
      is a relatively simple class which represents a location on the Cartesian
      plane (optionally with an associated height value).
      <a class="javadoc" href="./javadoc/org/locationtech/jts/geom/Coordinate.html">Coordinate</a>s
      are usually treated as mutable objects, in order to simplify certain
      algorithms. <br>
      <br>
      A <a class="javadoc" href="./javadoc/org/locationtech/jts/geom/Point.html">Point</a>
      is a subclass of&nbsp;<a class="javadoc" href="./javadoc/org/locationtech/jts/geom/Geometry.html">
        Geometry</a> that also represents a location on the Cartesian plane. It
      is a "heavy-weight" object (which for instance may contain an envelope)
      which support all methods that apply to <a class="javadoc" href="./javadoc/org/locationtech/jts/geom/Geometry.html">
        Geometry</a>s. <br>
      <h3>4. Does JTS support 3D operations?<a name="B4"></a></h3>
      JTS does not provide support for true 3D&nbsp;<a class="javadoc" href="./javadoc/org/locationtech/jts/geom/Geometry.html">
        Geometry</a> and operations. However, JTS does allow <a class="javadoc" href="./javadoc/org/locationtech/jts/geom/Coordinate.html">Coordinate</a>s
      to carry an elevation or Z value. This does not provide true 3D support,
      but does allow "2.5D" uses which are required in some geospatial
      applications. <br>
      <h3>5. What coordinate system and/or units does JTS use?<a name="B5"></a></h3>
      JTS uses the implicit coordinate system of the input data. The only
      assumption it makes is that the coordinate system is infinite, planar and
      Euclidean (i.e. rectilinear and obeying the standard Euclidean distance
      metric). In the same way JTS does not specify any particular units for
      coordinates and geometries. Instead, the units are implicitly defined by
      the input data provided. This implies that in most cases input geometries
      to operations should be defined with the same coordinate system. <br>
      <h2>C. Geometry Predicates<a name="predicates"></a></h2>
      <h3>1. How are spatial predicates computed?<a name="C1"></a></h3>
      The two input geometries are decomposed into labelled topology graphs (<a class="javadoc"
        href="./javadoc/org/locationtech/jts/geomgraph/GeometryGraph.html">GeometryGraph</a>s).
      The labels are on the nodes and edges of the graphs. They contain full
      information about the topology of the node/edge in the
      points/lines/polygons of the original geometry. The labelled topology
      graphs are merged. This includes merging the labels wherever there is
      common nodes or edges. For each geometry at each node, the label
      information is propagated to all edges incident on that node. The
      resulting relationship (Intersection Matrix, or IM) is determined by the
      merged label information at the nodes of the merged graph. The labelling
      of each node and its incident edges is inspected, and the topological
      relationship information it contributes is added to the overall IM. At the
      end of this process the IM has been completely determined. <br>
      <h3>2. Why does relate(POINT(20 20), POINT(20 30), "FF0FFF0F2") = true?<a
          name="C2"></a></h3>
      According to the SFS 1.1, section 2.1.3: <br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>The boundary of a Point is the
        empty set </em><br>
      <br>
      Since points do not have boundaries, all the intersection matrix entries
      relating to the geometry boundaries are "F". <br>
      <br>
      In some situations it is desirable to use a different definition for
      determining whether geometry endpoints are on their boundary. To support
      this, JTS provides the ability to specify a custom <a class="javadoc" href="./javadoc/org/locationtech/jts/algorithm/BoundaryNodeRule.html">BoundaryNodeRule</a>
      to the <a class="javadoc" href="./javadoc/org/locationtech/jts/operation/relate/RelateOp.html">RelateOp</a>
      class. <br>
      <h3>3. Why is the result of a predicate different in JTS than in another
        software application/library?<a name="C3"></a></h3>
      This is usually due to the fact that JTS predicates are computed exactly,
      using the full precision of the double-precision coordinates. Other
      geometry engines sometimes compute in lower precision, or round input
      coordinates, or use a tolerance when determining whether two lines
      intersect or cross. <br>
      <br>
      As a specific example, in the following case: <br>
      <br>
      <div class='wkt'>A: POLYGON ((1368.62186660165 17722.3281808793, -1653 9287.5,
        4038.14058906538 8613.02390521266, 1368.62186660165 17722.3281808793)) </div>
      <div class='wkt'>B: POLYGON ((-5846 9287.5, 7453 8380, 9082 16600, -6326.5 18842,
        -5846 9287.5)) </div>
      <br>
      JTS reports <code class='wkt'>A.overlaps(B) = true</code>, whereas another
      application reports false. The <a class="javadoc" href="./javadoc/org/locationtech/jts/geom/Geometry.html#overlaps%28org.locationtech.jts.geom.Geometry%29">Overlaps</a>
      result is correct - the bottom right point in the triangle B lies outside
      the quadrilateral A. This is demonstrated by intersecting the bottom edge
      of A <br>
      <br>
      <div class='wkt'>LINESTRING (-5846 9287.5, 7453 8380) </div>
      <br>
      with B. The value of the intersection is a line segment: <br>
      <br>
      <div class='wkt'>LINESTRING (4038.140589065375 8613.02390521266, 4038.14058906538
        8613.02390521266) </div>
      <br>
      which shows that B crosses the boundary of A, and thus overlaps A. <br>
      <h2>D. Robustness &amp; Precision<a name="robustness"></a></h2>
      <h3>1. Why is a TopologyException thrown?<a name="D1"></a></h3>
      <a class="javadoc" href="./javadoc/org/locationtech/jts/geom/TopologyException.html">TopologyException</a>s
      are thrown when JTS encounters an inconsistency in the internal topology
      structures it creates to compute certain spatial operations (in
      particular, <strong>spatial predicates</strong> and <strong>overlay
        operations</strong>). These inconsistencies can happen for two reasons:
      <br>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Invalid input geometry</strong>. If input geometry is
          invalid according to the JTS (and OGC SFS) model, the results of
          operations is undefined, and may produce exceptions. <a class="javadoc" href="./javadoc/org/locationtech/jts/geom/Geometry.html">Geometry</a>
          validity can be checked by using the <a class="javadoc" href="./javadoc/org/locationtech/jts/geom/Geometry.html#isValid--">isValid()</a>
          method. </li>
        <li><strong>Robustness failure</strong> due to floating-point roundoff
          errors. Floating-point errors can cause incorrect results to be
          computed for internal operations (such as computing point-line
          orientation, computing the intersection of two line segments, or
          computing the noded arrangement of a set of line segments). </li>
      </ol>
      Both of these situations can cause the topological properties of computed
      geometries to become inconsistent. When this issue is detected JTS throws
      a <a class="javadoc" href="./javadoc/org/locationtech/jts/geom/TopologyException.html">TopologyException</a>.
      <br>
      <br>
      In some rare cases, it is not possible to recognize an inconsistent
      topological situation. In these cases, no exception will be thrown, but
      the returned geometry will not correctly reflect the true result of the
      operation. JTS contains special checks to detect and prevent this from
      occurring for the overwhelming majority of inputs, however. <br>
      <br>
      Unfortunately there is no guaranteed way of avoiding <a class="javadoc" href="./javadoc/org/locationtech/jts/geom/TopologyException.html">TopologyException</a>s.
      However, a heuristic which often helps is to ensure that input geometry
      coordinates do not carry excessive precision. Instead of providing
      coordinates with a full 16 digits of precision (which usually far exceeds
      the actual accuracy of the input data), try reducing precision to a few
      decimal places. Of course, correct geometry topology must still be
      maintained. (This is primarily an issue for polygons, and can be tricky to
      do in some pathological cases). JTS provides the
      <a class="javadoc" href="./javadoc/org/locationtech/jts/precision/SimpleGeometryPrecisionReducer.html./javadoc/org/locationtech/jts/precision/SimpleGeometryPrecisionReducer.html">
        SimpleGeometryPrecisionReducer</a> class to do a simple reduction in
      coordinate precision, although this class is not guaranteed to maintain
      correct geometry topology. <br>
      <h3>2. Why does the coordinate given in a TopologyException not appear in
        the input data?<a name="D2"><br>
        </a></h3>
      In order to reduce robustness problems during overlay operations, JTS/<a class="javadoc" href="https://trac.osgeo.org/geos/">GEOS</a>
      sometimes transforms geometry into a different coordinate system. The
      coordinates in a <a class="javadoc" href="./javadoc/org/locationtech/jts/geom/TopologyException.html">TopologyException</a>
      message are presented in the working coordinate system, rather than the
      input coordinate system. This may not match the input data. <br>
      <h3>3. What is a "robustness failure"?<a name="D3"></a></h3>
      A <strong>robustness failure</strong> is a situation in which a JTS
      operation on valid inputs either fails to complete (by throwing an
      exception) or produces an incorrect answer. This situation is usually
      caused by the unavoidable internal finite-precision arithmetic causing
      round-off error, which in turn causes invalid geometric topology to be
      created at some point during the evaluation of the algorithm. <br>
      <br>
      The operations which are notably susceptible to robustness errors are the
      overlay operations (intersection, union, difference and symDifference).
      The input geometries which are most likely to trigger this behavior are
      ones which contain a lot of precision (e.g. 14-16 significant digits of
      precision), and/or ones which contain line segments which are nearly, but
      not exactly, coincident. <br>

      <h3>4. What is a "topology collapse"?<a name="D4"></a></h3>
      A <strong>topology collapse</strong> is a situation in which the
      finite-precision numerical representation used in JTS (Java's IEEE-754
      double-precision floating point) is unable to accurately represent a
      particular geometric configuration exactly. This causes vertices to be
      slightly shifted from their mathematically exact position. In certain
      geometric configurations, this can result in the computed geometry being
      topologically invalid. <br>
      <br>
      Typically this occurs in situations where polygon vertices are very close
      to other line segments. If the vertex is shifted slightly it may cross the
      line segment, resulting in a ring which self-intersects. <br>
<!--  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
      <h3>5. What is the PrecisionModel for?<a name="D5"></a></h3>

      The PrecisionModel specifies the precision of the coordinates used to define geometries.
	  Note that JTS expects that coordinates are supplied already rounded to the desired
	  precision model; it does not perform this automatically during geometry creation.
	  <br>
	  For some operations the Precision Model also specifies the precision in which computation is performed, 
	  and in which computed results are constructed.  However, this is not uniform
	  across all operations.  For instance, the the overlay and buffer operations
	  <b>do</b> obey the precision model, but the spatial predicates do not.
	  <br>	 
<!--  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- --> 
<h3>6. Why does JTS not enforce the specified PrecisionModel when creating
        new geometry?<a name="D6"></a></h3>

The PrecisionModel specified in a GeometryFactory is not applied to the coordinates 
 supplied when creating geomtries with the factory.  This is because:
 <ol>
  <li>Changing the precision of coordinates is in general a non-trivial operation,
      since it can cause topology collapse (see <a href="#D4">D4</a>.  </li>
  <li>Changing coordinate values adds significant overhead, 
    since <code>CoordinateSequence</code>s may not be mutable, and thus would require a full copy being made</li>
  <li>Commonly the input is already precise, and thus changing precision is not required</li>
</ol> 
<br>
<!--  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- --> 
      <h3>7. Why do the overlay operations not obey the axioms of set theory?<a
          name="D7"></a></h3>
		  
      This is sometimes posed as:
      <br>
      <br>
      "Why is the <code>intersection</code> of two geometries not contained in either
      of the originals?" <br>
      <br>
      or: "Why does the <code>union</code> of two geometries not contain either of
      the originals?" <br>
      <br>
      or: "Why does <code class="wkt">A union (B difference A) != A </code>?"
      <br>
      <br>
      The axioms of geometric set theory apply in a theoretical world in which
      all arithmetic is carried out exactly with infite precision real numbers.
      In this world operations such as union and intersection are exact, which
      in turn means that they are commutative and associative. This allows
      equations such as
      <code class="wkt">A union (B difference A) = A </code>
      to hold. <br>
      <br>
      JTS only approximates this ideal by simulating it using finite-precision
      floating point arithmetic. JTS uses double-precision floating point
      numbers to represent the coordinates of geometries (specifically, IEEE-754
      double-precision floating point, which provides 56 bits of precision).
      This provides the illusion of computing using real numbers - but it's only
      an illusion. The finite representation of real numbers forces rounding to
      take place during arithmetic computation. This means that operations are
      not commutative or associative. This in turn has the effect that geometric
      axioms are not maintained. (For the same reason, as is well known and
      documented, finite-precision floating-point computation does not fully
      obey the axioms of arithmetic.) <br>
      <br>
      Furthermore, JTS contains code which adjusts input geometries in small
      ways in order to try and prevent robustness errors from occuring. These
      minor perturbations may also result in computed results which do not
      necessarily obey the set theory axioms. <br>
      <br>
      However, a major JTS design goal is that the output of geometric
      operations is "close" to the theoretically correct result (using some
      small epsilon of tolerance and a suitable geometric distance metric.) This
      is the best that can be achieved under the finite-precision paradigm. This
      goal is generally met by the JTS algorithms. Moreover, the precision of
      JTS geometric operations is almost always much greater than the inherent
      accuracy of the input data. <br>
<!-- ----------------------------------------  -->
      <h3>8. Why is the result of <code>intersects</code> inconsistent with the result of <code>intersection</code> ?<a name="D8"></a></h3>
		
	The inconsistent case is:
<pre>
A = LINESTRING(0.0 0.0, -10.0 1.2246467991473533E-15)
B = LINESTRING(-9.999143275740073 -0.13089595571333978, -10.0 1.0535676356486768E-13)
</pre>
This case produces the following inconsistent results:
<pre>
A.intersects(B) = false
A.intersection(B) = POINT (-10 0.0000000000000012)
</pre>

      This is a specific case of D7 above. It is interesting because it shows
      how simple geometric cases can reveal the limitations of
      finite-precision binary floating-point arithmetic. 
	  It also highlights the impact of design choices made in JTS.
	  Specifically, JTS computes spatial predicates (including <code>intersects</code>) using high-precision arithemtic.
	  This determines the exact spatial relationship of the input geometries.
	  In contrast, the overlay operations (including <code>intersection</code>) use standard double-precision arithmetic
	  to compute intersection points, and the computed point is necessarily represented
	  in double-precision.
	  This has the effect that there are cases where the results of spatial predicates is not be consistent 
	  with the result of overlay operations.  
	<br>
<!-- ----------------------------------------  -->
      <h3>9. How can I prevent TopologyExceptions or incorrect results in
        overlay operations?<a name="D9"></a></h3>
		
      <a class="javadoc" href="./javadoc/org/locationtech/jts/geom/TopologyException.html">TopologyException</a>s
      and incorrect results encountered during overlay computations are symptoms
      of robustness issues. Robustness issues are caused by the limitations of
      using finite-precision numerics in geometric algorithms. <br>
      <br>
      Currently the surest way to prevent robustness issues is to limit the
      numerical precision of the input geometries to something less than the
      available 16 digits. To be safe, the precision of the input geometry
      coordinates should be no more than 14 decimal digits (and possibly as few
      as 10 or 12). This is still plenty of precision to represent the accuracy
      of real-world data. <br>
      <br>
      Reducing the precision of the input data means that result vertices will
      not perfectly match the input ones. Thus this technique is particularly
      useful in situations where it is not necessary to perfectly preserve
      vertex-to-vertex faithfulness to the source geometry. Example use cases
      are:
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li>the result is only used to obtain derived quantities such as area or
          length </li>
        <li>the result is only used for visualization purposes </li>
        <li>the result vertices do not need to fully match the input </li>
      </ul>

      precision can be controlled in several ways: <br>
      <ul>
        <li>the best way is to ensure that the original source of the input
          geometries provides only as much precision as is really required. If
          this is not possible to enforce, then it will be necessary to reduce
          the precision of the geometries once they are created. </li>

      <h3>1. Are there any references which describe the algorithms used in JTS?<a
          name="E1"></a></h3>
      Many of the details of JTS algorithms (particularly in the areas of
      performance and robustness) are unique to JTS. However, the general design
      of the algorithms for computing spatial predicates and spatial overlay
      follow a generally accepted strategy for computing with 2-dimensional
      planar linear topological structures. Some papers which present similar
      approaches are: <br>

      <h3>2. Is there a skeletonization algorithm which works with JTS?<a name="E2"></a></h3>
      Yes. See the Refractions Research Skeletonizer <br>
	  
<h3>3. How can JTS split a polygon with a linestring?<a name="E3"></a></h3>
Currently JTS does not contain a <b>Split Polygon By Line</b> operation.  
Thus the only way to do this is to construct a "splitting" polygon which contains the linestring
and surrounds one side of the target polygon without touching it.  
Then the overlay operations <code>intersection</code> and <code>difference</code>
can be used to extract the two sides of the target polygon.
Constructing the splitting polygon is obviously easier when the linestring is a straight line;
and simplest if it is horizontal or vertical.
	  
      <h2>F. Geodetic Operations<a name="geodetic_operations"></a></h2>
      <h3>1. Does JTS support computation on the geodetic ellipsoid?<a name="F1"></a></h3>
      No. JTS currently assumes that geometries are defined in a Cartesian,
      planar, 2-dimensional space. Thus it cannot be used to compute accurate
      metrics, predicates or constructions on the geodetic ellipsoid which is
      usually used to model the surface of the Earth. <br>
      <br>
      It is hoped to provide geodetic operations in a future version. <br>
      <h3>2. Can JTS be used to compute a geographically accurate range circle?<a
          name="F2"></a></h3>
      A geographically accurate range circle is a shape on the ellipsoid
      modelling the surface of the Earth which represents all points which are a
      given distance from a fixed point on the ellipsoid. This is a more
      complicated shape than either a circle or even an ellipsoid. In general
      JTS cannot compute this shape, since JTS assumes a Cartesian coordinate
      system (i.e. a two-dimensional plane extending infinitely in all
      directions). This is obviously not a good approximation to the surface of
      the ellipsoid, except over very small distances. Computing a true range
      circle requires complex spherical mathematics as well as a richer
      coordinate system model. This is outside the current scope of JTS. <br>

      <h3>1. How can I correct the topology of a Polygon that JTS is reporting
        as invalid?<a name="G1"></a></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Compute <a class="javadoc" href="./javadoc/org/locationtech/jts/geom/Geometry.html#buffer-double-">polygon.buffer(0)</a>.
          The buffer operation is fairly insensitive to topological invalidity,
          and the act of computing the buffer can often resolve minor issues
          such as self-intersecting rings. However, in some situations the
          computed result may not be what is desired. </li>
        <li>If holes are overlapping the shell or other holes, create individual
          polygons from the shell and all the holes, and then subtract the holes
          from the shell. </li>
